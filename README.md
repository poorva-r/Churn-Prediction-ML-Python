# Churn-Prediction-ML-Python

## Project Description
This repository contains the code for a Telecom Churn Classification project, focusing on predicting churn behavior in a telecom dataset. The objective is to identify customers likely to churn based on various features. The project involves loading the dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights, preprocessing the data, and implementing a Random Forest model for classification.

## Project Workflow
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted comprehensive visualizations and exploratory data analysis on the telecom dataset using Seaborn to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Explored key features and relationships within the data to inform subsequent modeling decisions.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded and prepared the telecom dataset for analysis.
- Performed data preprocessing steps, including label encoding and scaling, to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

### Model Training:
- Utilized the Random Forest model for predicting churn behavior.
- Trained the model using relevant features.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated the Random Forest model's performance using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
